# Projects

The projects end point should have terminal like Functionality for desktop

- When the projects DIR is loaded the site should determine if the browser is in desktop mode
- If the device is in mobile the view of projects should simply just be an unordered list

  - IDEA: May or may not check using display dimensions

- The Desktop mode should have the following features for the _shell_
  - `neofetch` should print candy
  - `help` should print the list of commands
  - **HOME**
    - `ls` should print everything in the current working directory (list the projects if not in directory)
    - `cd` should go into the project directories (go back to home when no other params are listed)
  - **PROJECT**
    - `ls` list all files in the project
    - `edit SOMEFILE` command should open a given file with [web editor](https://dev.to/developerbishwas/svelte-text-editor-tipex-a-modern-powerful-editor-that-everybody-wanted-4hmc)
      or [another editor](https://github.com/umaranis/svelte-lexical)
